USER GUIDE FOR VISUALIZATION SCRIPTS

Both polviz.py and viz.py are python3 scripts and require the numpy module. After executed, required information will be requested interactively.

################# Script polviz.py ##################################

1. Reads *.cosmo files created by COSMO/Turbomole calculations, or *.cpcm files created by CPCM/Orca calculations. The full Orca output file is also required in the latter case.

2. Creates a "*.viz.cosmo" file, used by TmoleX (COSMOview) to produce an image distinguishing nonpolar (green) and polar (blue) surfaces estimates. 
 
Example of requested information for the provided input example file (out.cosmo):
Enter program name. tur (Turbomole) or orc (Orca).
tur
Enter .cosmo filename, but without the .cosmo extension.
out
Enter treshold for segment charge density (e/Angstrom^2). 
0.01

output: file out.polviz.cosmo.

################# Script viz.py ##################################
  
1. Reads *.cosmo files created by COSMO/Turbomole calculations, or *.cpcm files created by CPCM/Orca calculations. The full Orca output file is also required in the latter case.

2. Creates a "*.spt" script, which should be read by Jmol. Internal, polar and nonpolar atoms will be colored yellow, red and blue, respectively. 

3. Creates a "*.area.txt" file, which contains the polar and total areas for each atom.

4. Prints to terminal the calculated total area, total polar area and their difference (should be equal to NPSA) of the molecule.

Example of requested information for the provided input example file (out.cosmo):
Enter program name. tur (Turbomole) or orc (Orca).
tur
Enter .cosmo filename.
out.cosmo
Enter treshold for segment charge density (e/Angstrom^2). 
0.01
Enter treshold for atom area, from 0 to 1. 
0.5

output: files out.cosmo.spt and out.cosmo.area.txt. Also, the following information is printed to terminal:
In Angstrom^2
Total area =  1923.5188100980006
Total polar area =  257.94243384299995
NPSA =  1665.5763762550007
